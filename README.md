    First, you need to run the IPFS daemon, you can use local IPFS daemon or the IPFS daemon on the cloud. 
    ```
    ```
    Then, you need to start hardhat node, so that you can deploy the smart contract to the hardhat node. It`s used to deploy the smart contract, so we can through the abi to interact with the smart contract. 
    ```
    npx hardhat node
    ```
    Then, you need to deploy the smart contract to the hardhat node.
    ```
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

    Or you can deploy the smart through remix.(make sure your remix is connected with the hardhat node)

    Finally, you can run the server.

    > Tip: You need to change the address of the smart contract and your account in the code.
